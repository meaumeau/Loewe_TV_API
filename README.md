# Loewe_TV_API
A module for controlling Loewe TVs


Disclaimer this is at the moment a proof of concept im still working on it and i am not a programmer just trying
to integrate my TV in to homeassistant so this is a start 

its also only syncronus at this time its wil become async but is just want the first basic control covert
and to uderstand how the soap protocol works because the documention of the loewe remote api is very unclear if u dont know anything about soap
there a two pdf's included one is the orginal API manual and the second one is an OCR scanned
version to make it searchable there are alot of Erors in that one
